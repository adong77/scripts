| Dir        | Function           | Note  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| workflow      | Run multiple jobs on HPC | **bash** maybe the most efficient way to manage multiple jobs |
| MISC scripts/genomics    | Manuipulate genomic sequences and reads  | **python** or **perl** is the best for manipulating text/sequences; I know perl better  |
| RNA Structure scripts    | fold RNA 2nd structures  | folding needs speed, so we used **c++**  |
| Rscript | plot, statisctics and machine learning     | **R** or **Matlab** is the best way to deal with matrix data, develop a model or plot a figure  |
